# Real NVP for Two Moons
PyTorch implementation of Real NVP for Two Moons

## Description
This is implementation of real-valued non-volume preserving(real NVP) for Density Estimation(real NVP). I used Two Moons dataset of sklearn and tried to reproduce fig.1 in the paper. 

## Results
The following results were obtained with the default setting. (command: python main.py)
